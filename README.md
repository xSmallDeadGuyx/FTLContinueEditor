FTLContinueEditor
=================

An editor for the continue.sav file in FTL. My plan is to go beyond what the normal editors do such as allowing the editing of cargo, weapons, ship art, sectors, and jumps. A lot of the file format is documented but there is a large section (my guess is the sectors+jumps) that still needs reverse engineering. I'll also be doing that.
